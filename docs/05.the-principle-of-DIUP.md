# The principle of "Don't install unnecessary packages"

## Summary

The principle of **"Don't install unnecessary packages"** in a Dockerfile refers to the practice of including only the essential dependencies and packages that are required for your application to run. This ensures your Docker image is lean, secure, and efficient.

## Why Should You Avoid Installing Unnecessary Packages?

1. **Smaller Image Size**: Unnecessary packages increase the size of your Docker image, making it slower to build, upload, and download. This can impact the speed of deployments and resource usage.

2. **Improved Security**: Every additional package introduces a potential security risk, as it could have vulnerabilities. By minimizing the number of packages, you reduce the attack surface and overall risk of security breaches.

3. **Better Performance**: The fewer dependencies and packages your container has, the faster it can start and execute. Unnecessary packages may also consume resources like CPU and memory.

4. **Reduced Complexity**: By installing only what’s needed, you keep your environment simple and predictable. It’s easier to troubleshoot, maintain, and update your Docker image when there are fewer components to manage.

## How to Avoid Installing Unnecessary Packages in a Dockerfile

1. **Use Minimal Base Images**: Choose a minimal base image such as alpine (for Linux-based applications) instead of heavier images like ubuntu or debian. Alpine is much smaller and provides only the necessary core tools.

```Dockerfile
FROM node:14-alpine
```

2. **Install Only Production Dependencies**: For package managers (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.), install only the dependencies needed for running the application in production. Avoid installing development dependencies (like testing libraries, debuggers, etc.) in the production image.

```Dockerfile
# Install only required packages in production
RUN pip install --no-dev -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Avoid Installing Unnecessary Build Tools**

- Some dependencies require build tools like gcc or make for compilation. If these tools are only needed during the build phase, avoid keeping them in the final image.
- You can achieve this by using multi-stage builds, where the build tools are installed in one stage and removed from the final stage.

Example for multi-stage builds:
```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build stage with build tools
FROM golang:1.17 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

# Stage 2: Final image without build tools
FROM alpine:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp .
CMD ["./myapp"]
```

4. **Remove Unneeded Files After Installation**: After installing packages, clean up package caches, temp files, or package managers that are no longer needed. This helps reduce the final image size.

Example for apt in Ubuntu/Debian-based images:
```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    curl \
    git \
&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

5. **Avoid Installing Unnecessary Base Utilities**: When using `apt`, `yum`, or similar package managers, be selective about the utilities and tools you install. Avoid installing entire groups of packages (e.g., build-essential) unless absolutely required.

```Dockerfile
# Instead of installing build-essential, just install the needed packages
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc g++
```

6. **Use Specific Versions of Packages**: Pin your package versions to specific versions that you know are required for the application to function. This prevents your image from pulling in unwanted updates or incompatible versions in the future.
