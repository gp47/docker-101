# Leverage the build cache

## Summary

Leveraging the build cache in a Dockerfile is a crucial optimization technique for speeding up Docker image builds. Docker uses a layered file system where each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a new layer. When you rebuild an image, Docker checks if it can reuse any of the existing layers from a previous build, which can significantly reduce build times.

## What is Docker Build Cache?

The **Docker build cache** is a mechanism that stores previously built layers from Dockerfile instructions. If an instruction and its context haven’t changed since the last build, Docker can reuse the cached layer instead of rebuilding it, saving time and resources. Docker compares the current state of the build with the cached layers to decide whether to reuse them.

## How Does Docker Leverage Build Cache?

1. **Layer Reuse**: Each instruction (like RUN, COPY, ADD, etc.) creates a layer in the image. Docker caches these layers so that if the same instruction with the same inputs (e.g., source files, environment variables, commands) appears in future builds, Docker will reuse the layer from the cache.
2. **Cache Matching**: Docker checks the instructions in the Dockerfile from top to bottom. When it finds a change in an instruction or its context (e.g., a new file was added or a command changed), it invalidates the cache for that and subsequent layers. The preceding layers are still cached, so Docker reuses them.

## Example: Basic Docker Build Cache Usage

```Dockerfile
# Step 1: Use a base image
FROM node:14-alpine

# Step 2: Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy package files
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Step 4: Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Step 5: Copy application source code
COPY . .

# Step 6: Expose the port and run the application
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

### How Docker Caches Each Layer

- **Step 1**: The base image (node:14-alpine) is pulled, and Docker will cache this image locally. If the base image hasn’t changed between builds, Docker uses the cached base image.
- **Step 2**: The working directory instruction (WORKDIR /app) does not change often, so Docker caches this layer.
- **Step 3**: Docker checks the hash of the package.json and package-lock.json files. If these files haven’t changed, Docker reuses the cached result of this step.
- **Step 4**: If package.json or package-lock.json hasn't changed, Docker will skip installing the dependencies again because it uses the cached output of npm install.
- **Step 5**: The COPY . . command copies the entire project. If any file in the source code has changed, Docker will invalidate this layer and rebuild everything below it, but all preceding layers will remain cached.

## Why is Cache Efficiency Important?

1. **Speeds Up Builds**: If most layers remain unchanged, Docker can reuse cached layers, significantly reducing build times. This is especially useful in large projects where installing dependencies and building the application can be time-consuming.
2. **Reduces Network Traffic**: By using the cache, Docker avoids downloading or rebuilding large packages, libraries, or base images if they haven't changed.
3. **Minimizes Compute Resources**: Reusing cache means that CPU and memory resources are saved, as Docker doesn’t need to re-execute instructions that haven’t changed.
4. **Improves CI/CD Pipeline Efficiency**: In Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, caching can drastically reduce build times, leading to faster feedback loops and quicker deployments.

## Best Practices for Leveraging Docker Build Cache

1. **Order Instructions from Least to Most Frequently Changed**: Docker builds the image from top to bottom, and once a layer changes, all subsequent layers must be rebuilt. Therefore, put the instructions that change less frequently (e.g., base images, dependency installations) earlier in the `Dockerfile`, and place frequently changing files (like source code) later.

2. **Avoid Invalidating the Cache Prematurely**: Ensure that operations that frequently change (such as copying source code or environment variables) are placed later in the Dockerfile. For example, don’t copy the entire project (with `COPY` `. .`) before installing dependencies, as that would invalidate the cache whenever any file in the project changes.

3. **Use `COPY` and `ADD` Efficiently**: `COPY` and `ADD` instructions can invalidate the cache if even a single byte changes in the files they reference. To avoid cache invalidation:
- Only copy necessary files.
- Copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json` first to allow Docker to cache dependency installation steps (since these files change less often).

4. **Use Multistage Builds to Minimize Final Image Size**: Multistage builds allow you to use multiple `FROM` statements in a `Dockerfile`. This lets you cache build stages that include heavy dependencies (e.g., compilers) but discard unnecessary layers in the final production image.

5. **Use ARG and ENV Efficiently**: `ARG` (build-time variables): Variables declared with ARG do not affect the cache unless used in an instruction.
`ENV` (environment variables): Environment variables (`ENV`) impact the build cache. If you need to change environment variables frequently, place the `ENV` instruction later in the Dockerfile to prevent invalidating earlier cached layers.

6. **Use `--no-cache` or `--pull` When Necessary**

You can force Docker to ignore the cache by using the --no-cache option:
```sh
docker build --no-cache -t my-image .
```

Or, if you want to ensure you’re using the latest base image:
```sh
docker build --pull -t my-image .
```

## Verifying Cache Usage

You can use the `docker build` command with the `--progress` flag to see whether Docker is using the cache:
```sh
docker build --progress=plain .
```

This will display detailed output about each step of the build process, showing whether a cached layer was used or if the step was rebuilt.
