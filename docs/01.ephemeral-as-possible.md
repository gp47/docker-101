# General guidline

## Summary 

Containers should be temporary and disposable, with no persistent state or data stored inside the container. The idea is that you can easily stop, remove, or replace a container without losing critical data or functionality.

## Stateless Containers

- Containers should not store any data that is needed long-term inside the container filesystem itself. If a container is removed, all its data is lost, so keeping them stateless ensures that losing a container has minimal impact.
- Use external storage mechanisms, such as Docker volumes or external databases, to persist data instead of storing it inside the container.

## Easy Replacement

- Containers should be designed so that they can be easily recreated or replaced. When a new version of the application is deployed, you should be able to stop the old container and start a new one without manual intervention.
- This helps with scaling and deployment automation. For instance, if a container fails or needs to be updated, you can spin up a new instance quickly without worrying about lost data.

## Short-Lived and Immutable

- Containers should be treated as immutable objects: once they are created and started, they shouldn't need to be modified. If changes are needed (e.g., software updates), a new container should be created from an updated image.
- You can think of containers as being disposable — they can be destroyed and replaced anytime without losing important state.

## Avoid Manual Configuration

- Any configuration required by the container should be done at the time of creation using environment variables or configuration files that are passed into the container. This allows containers to be consistent across environments (development, testing, production) and ensures that they don’t depend on manual changes.

## Use of Volumes for Persistent Data

If you need to store data that persists between container restarts, use Docker volumes or bind mounts. Volumes store data outside of the container’s lifecycle, allowing you to keep containers ephemeral while ensuring the necessary data persists.
