# How to use Docker MultiStage Builds

## Summary

Docker multi-stage builds are an advanced feature that helps you create optimized Docker images by separating the build environment from the final runtime environment. This approach reduces the size of your final image by including only the necessary files, dependencies, and tools required for production, while avoiding the overhead of build dependencies and tools.

## Advantage to use Multi-Stage Builds

- **Smaller Images**: With multi-stage builds, you can avoid bloating the final image with development tools, source files, or build dependencies. Only the necessary binaries or artifacts are copied to the final stage.

- **Cleaner and More Secure Images**: By separating the build and runtime environments, you minimize the attack surface and ensure that unnecessary tools and files are excluded from the final production image.

- **Better Performance**: Smaller images are faster to deploy and easier to work with in production environments.

## How Multi-Stage Builds Work

In a multi-stage build, you define multiple stages in your `Dockerfile`, and each stage produces an intermediate container. You can copy only the necessary output from one stage to another, eventually creating a lean final image with just the production files.

### Review of the Multi-Stage Build Process

```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM node:14 AS builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application source code
COPY . .

# Build the application (e.g., bundle with Webpack)
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production image
FROM node:14-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the build artifacts from the first stage
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json

# Install only production dependencies
RUN npm install --production

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the application
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

#### Stage 1: Build the Application

```Dockerfile
FROM node:14 AS builder
```

- This stage uses the full node:14 image with all necessary tools to build the app.
- We install all dependencies (including dev dependencies) using npm install.
- The application is built using a command like npm run build, which generates a bundled version of the app in the /app/dist directory.

This image is relatively large because it contains all the development tools, source code, and build dependencies. However, this stage will not be part of the final image.

#### Stage 2: Final Production Image

```Dockerfile
FROM node:14-alpine
```

- This stage uses `node:14-alpine`, a minimal image based on Alpine Linux. It is lightweight and suitable for running the application.
- We copy only the build artifacts from the `builder` stage (`/app/dist`) and the package.json file.
- We install only the production dependencies using `npm install --production`, which ensures the final image is lean.
- Finally, we define the `CMD` to run the application using the compiled files.

#### Copying Files Between Stages

```Dockerfile
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json
```
This line copies the compiled files from the builder stage into the final image, keeping only whatâ€™s needed for running the application.
