# How to use .dockerignore ?

## Summary

The `.dockerignore` file is used to tell Docker which files or directories to exclude from the build context when building an image. This is particularly useful for excluding unnecessary files (e.g., source control, logs, build artifacts) to reduce the size of the Docker image, speed up the build process, and improve security.

## Steps to Use `.dockerignore`

### Create a `.dockerignore` File

- In the root of your project (the same directory where your Dockerfile is located), create a file named `.dockerignore`.
- This file works similarly to a `.gitignore` file, and you define patterns to specify which files or directories to exclude from the Docker build context.

### Add Patterns to Exclude Files/Directories

- In the `.dockerignore` file, add the files and directories you want to exclude, following specific patterns. Each line represents a pattern for files or directories to ignore.
- Example `.dockerignore` file:

```sh
# Ignore node_modules directory
node_modules

# Ignore temporary files
*.log
*.tmp

# Ignore environment files
.env

# Ignore version control directories
.git
.gitignore

# Ignore build artifacts
dist
build
```

### Common Patterns in `.dockerignore`

**Exclude Directories**: If you want to exclude an entire directory, just add its name.

```sh
node_modules/
dist/
```

**Exclude Specific File Types**: You can use wildcards to exclude files based on file extensions or name patterns.

```sh
*.log      # Exclude all .log files
*.tmp      # Exclude all temporary files
```

**Exclude Hidden Files**: To exclude hidden files, use the pattern with a . at the beginning.

```sh
.git/
.env
```

**Exclude Specific Files**: You can exclude specific files by specifying their full paths.

```sh
secret-key.txt
config/settings.json
```

**Commenting**: Use # to add comments in the .dockerignore file.

```sh
# Ignore temporary and log files
*.log
*.tmp
```

## How `.dockerignore` Works

When Docker builds an image, it sends everything in the build context (the directory containing the Dockerfile and its subdirectories) to the Docker daemon. The .dockerignore file tells Docker to ignore certain files or directories from being sent to the build context, reducing the size of the context and speeding up the build process.

The .dockerignore file is applied before the COPY or ADD instructions in the Dockerfile. Docker will not even consider copying the excluded files into the image.

### Example Scenario

Let’s say you have the following project structure:
```sh
my-app/
│
├── Dockerfile
├── .dockerignore
├── .git/
├── node_modules/
├── dist/
├── src/
├── .env
└── README.md
```

You want to build a Docker image but want to exclude the `.git` directory, `node_modules`, and `.env` file, as they are not necessary for running the application inside the container. You would create a `.dockerignore` file like this:
```sh
# Ignore node_modules directory
node_modules/

# Ignore git repository files
.git/

# Ignore local environment variables
.env

# Ignore the dist folder (build artifacts)
dist/

# Ignore log files
*.log
```

When you run `docker build .`, Docker will exclude all the files and directories specified in `.dockerignore`, making the build more efficient.
