# Avoid including unnecessary file

## Summary

This refers to ensuring that your Docker image only contains files that are essential for the application to run. This is important for several reasons, such as reducing image size, improving security, and optimizing performance.

## Smaller Image Size

- Including unnecessary files (e.g., temporary files, large source files, documentation, build artifacts) can make your Docker image significantly larger.
- A larger image means:
  - Slower build times.
  - Longer upload/download times when pushing or pulling the image from a registry.
  - More disk space usage on the host machine.

## Faster Build Times

- When unnecessary files are included in the image, Docker needs to process and copy them, which increases build time.
- Removing extraneous files helps speed up builds and allows Docker to efficiently use its caching mechanism.

## Improved Security

- Including unnecessary files can expose sensitive data or unused dependencies that can be security risks. For example, configuration files, API keys, or secrets could accidentally end up inside the image if not excluded.
- By stripping away files that arenâ€™t needed at runtime, you reduce the attack surface of your image and improve security.

## Optimized Performance

- Reducing the number of files means less clutter inside the container. This improves container startup time, reduces resource consumption, and enhances overall container performance.

## Efficient Caching

- Docker caches layers when building an image, but changes in files (even unnecessary ones) can invalidate the cache, forcing Docker to rebuild the affected layers. Keeping only necessary files ensures the cache remains valid for more builds, speeding up subsequent builds.

## How to Avoid Including Unnecessary Files

1. Use `.dockerignore`

The `.dockerignore` file functions similarly to .gitignore and tells Docker which files or directories to exclude when building the image. For example:
```
node_modules
.git
logs
temp/
.env
```

By properly configuring the `.dockerignore`, you can prevent Docker from copying large or irrelevant files into the build context.

2. Minimize Dependencies

Only install the dependencies required for production inside the container. For example, in a Node.js project, you can use npm install --production to install only production dependencies, excluding development packages.

3. Use Multi-Stage Builds

Multi-stage builds allow you to separate the build environment from the runtime environment. This means you can include build tools and other files in the build stage, but only copy the necessary binaries and files to the final runtime image. This is especially useful for large applications with complex build processes.

Example:
```sh
# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:14 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json .
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Final Image
FROM node:14-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./
RUN npm install --production
CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

4. Remove Build Artifacts

Remove unnecessary build artifacts and temporary files after the build process is complete. You can do this by using the `RUN` command to delete files during the build process:
```sh
RUN make && make install && rm -rf /tmp/* /var/cache/*
```
