# Sort multi-line arguments in Dockerfile

## Summary

Sorting multi-line arguments in a Dockerfile is a best practice to improve readability, maintainability, and to take advantage of Dockerâ€™s layer caching. This practice is especially useful when dealing with commands like `RUN`, `COPY`, or package installations (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `npm`, `pip`). By sorting the arguments, you make the Dockerfile easier to review, track changes, and ensure that changes to a specific dependency are easier to detect.

## Benefit of Sort Multi-Line Arguments

- **Better Readability**: Sorted arguments are easier to read, especially when managing long lists of dependencies.
- **Consistency**: Sorting arguments ensures consistency in the order of dependencies across different builds or environments.
- **Efficient Caching**: Docker caches each layer of an image. Sorting helps to prevent unnecessary cache invalidation. If arguments are added in random order, Docker may treat every new order as a change, breaking the cache.
- **Reduce Merge Conflicts**: In a multi-developer environment, sorting helps reduce the chances of merge conflicts when multiple contributors modify the Dockerfile.

## How to Sort Multi-Line Arguments?

- **Alphabetical Sorting**: This is the most straightforward and common way to sort multi-line arguments, particularly package names. Arrange items alphabetically to ensure consistency.
- **Logical Grouping**: In some cases, it makes sense to group arguments logically (e.g., related packages), then sort within those groups.
